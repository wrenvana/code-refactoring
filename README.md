I am updating this website to be up to standards for accessibility.

The tasks I executed to complete this task included ensuring the header elements were in descending order, changing the footer header from h2 to h4, organizing the CSS elements to be in the same order that they were organized on the HTML page, giving each image an alt tag, and adding semantic HTML elements.

Additionally, the Search Engine Optimization link was fixed.
